# Password-Manager
Handling your passwords responsibly is the number one way you can make yourself less vulnerable to hacking. In order to do so you should:
-Make your passwords long
-Make your passwords nonsensical including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
-Never reuse passwords
-Change your passwords regularly
