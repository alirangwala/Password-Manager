# Password-Manager
Handling your passwords responsibly is the number one way you can be less vulnerable to hacking. In order to do so you should:

1. Make your passwords long
2. Make your passwords nonsensical including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
3. Never reuse passwords
4. Change your passwords regularly

This is a command line application that stores and secures your passwords on your local drive and addresses all of the above issues. The app uses SQLite to create a database for your information. Note a safe.db or pwsafe.db file will be created when using these apps and should NOT be deleted.

pwstorer.py is my original app that uses the command line inspired by Youtuber Kalle Hallden

main.py and PWStorer.kv is a kivy GUI that I experimented with
